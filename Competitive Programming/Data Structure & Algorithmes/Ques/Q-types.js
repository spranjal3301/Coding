//! Heuristic  # 1
//* If we are dealing with
//* top/maximum/minimum/closest 'K' elements among 'N' elements,
//* we will be using a Heap

//! Heuristic  # 2
//* If we are dealing with
//* Maximize the minimum or Minimize the maximum
//* We will be using Binary Search

//! Heuristic  # 3
//* If the given input is a sorted array
//* or a list, we will either be using
//* Binray Search or the Two Pointers
//* strategy.

//! Heuristic  # 4
//* If we need to try all combinations
//* (or permutations) of the input, wecan either use Backtracking or
//* Breadth First Search.

//! Heuristic  # 5
//* If we need to find the best (or worst)(optimization (e.g., maximizationor minimization),)
//* options available, we can use Dynamic
//* Programming.

//! Heuristic  # 6
//* If we need to find some common
//* substring among a set of strings,we will be using a HashMap or a
//* Trie

//! Heuristic  # 7
//* If the problem is related to a
//* LinkedList and we can't use extraspace, then use the Fast & SlowPointer approach.

//! Heuristic  # 8
//* If the problem is related to a  
//* subarray or a contiguous subarray, we can use the 
//* Sliding Window or Prefix Sum approach
