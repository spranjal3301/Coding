//! Disjoint Set
//* Two sets are called disjoint sets if they donâ€™t have any element in common, the intersection of sets is a null set.

//~ The disjoint set data structure supports following operations:
//* Adding new sets to the disjoint set.
//* Merging disjoint sets to a single disjoint set using Union operation.
//* Finding representative of a disjoint set using Find operation.
//* Check if two sets are disjoint or not. 

//~ Union by Rank & Path Compression
