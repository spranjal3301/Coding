!Eulerian Path and Circuit
-Undirected Graph:
*Eulerian circuit - every vertex has an even degree.
*Eulerian path - either every vertex has an even degree or exactly two vertices have an odd degree.

-Directed Graph:
*Eulerian circuit - every vertex has equal indegree and outdegree.
*Eulerian path - at most one vertex has (outdegree) - (indegree) = 1 and at most one vertex has (indegree) - (outdegree) = 1, and all other vertices have equal in and outdegrees.
