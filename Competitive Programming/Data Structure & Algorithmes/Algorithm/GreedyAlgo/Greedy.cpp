//! Greedy Algorithms
//! In greedy algorithms, we choose locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum solution
//* Greedy algorithms are used for optimization problems. 
//* An optimization problem can be solved using greedy algorithms if the problem has the following property: 
//* At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment, 
//* and we get the optimal solution of the complete problem.

//*Method Genrally used:
//* 1. Sorting(Custom Sort)
//* 2. min/max
//* 3. Priority Queue/Set
