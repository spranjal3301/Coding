!Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment(CI/CD)


`Continuous Integration (CI) 
*is a development practice where developers frequently integrate their code changes into a 
*shared repository, preferably several times a day. Each integration is automatically verified by 
*1.Building the project and 
*2.Running automated tests. 

*This process allows teams to detect problems early,
*improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate 
*and release new software updates.


`Continuous Deployment (CD)
*Is a software release process that uses automated testing to validate if changes to a codebase are correct and stable for immediate autonomous deployment to a production environment.

`Deploying a next.js app to EC2 servers via Docker 


- CI: .github/workflows/main.yml 
- CD: Dockerfile.prod +  .github/workflows/deploy.yml
docker build -t nextjs-app -f Dockerfile.prod .

`Configuring the EC2 instance before deploying the app:
-Crete a new EC2 instance
