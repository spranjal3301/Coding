!Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment(CI/CD)


`Continuous Integration (CI) 
*is a development practice where developers frequently integrate their code changes into a 
*shared repository, preferably several times a day. Each integration is automatically verified by 
*1.Building the project and 
*2.Running automated tests. 

*This process allows teams to detect problems early,
*improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate 
*and release new software updates.


`Continuous Deployment (CD)
*is a software release process that uses automated testing to validate if changes to a codebase are correct and stable for immediate autonomous deployment to a production environment.
