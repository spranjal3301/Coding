Component-Sphere is a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your web apps.


It primarily focuses on reusable components, modules, and utilities designed to streamline development and promote consistency across projects.


## Philosophy

**I believe reusability is a cornerstone of efficient and scalable software development.** Writing the same code to create identical components in multiple projects is a significant waste of time and effort. It violates the DRY principle and introduces redundancy, increasing the likelihood of inconsistencies and maintenance overhead.



**Reusable components, on the other hand, demonstrate that the team values efficiency and quality.** 

It makes me think, *"If they put this much effort into reusable solutions, they must be thoughtful and systematic in how they approach challenges across the board."*

**Ultimately, adhering to DRY principles doesnâ€™t just save time; it fosters trust in the team's engineering discipline.**

This library is heavily inspired by [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) , [MagicUI](https://magicui.design/) and [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/).
