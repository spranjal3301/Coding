// - NodeJS Vertical Scaling
//     * Very Hard to scale vertically due to its single-threaded nature
//     * Can use clustering to utilize multiple CPU cores
//     * No Parallel processing in a single instance

// - Implementing horizontal scaling in Node.js project
//     * We can start multiple node projects then? If there are 8 cores, then just start 8 projects?
//     ? Problem: How to share the same port?
//             ? Just ugly to do this, keep track of the processes that are up and down
//             ? Processes will have port conflicts, youâ€™ll have to run each process on a saparate port

// - Cluter Module
//     * Node.js provides a built-in cluster module to create child processes that share the same server port
//     * Each child process can handle requests independently
//     * Allows for better utilization of multi-core systems
//     * This is a way to implement horizontal scaling in Node.js
//~ This is not true horizontal scaling, but rather a way to utilize multiple cores on a single machine
//~ This is different from multi threading, as each worker is a separate Node.js instance
//~ Slowly performance in comparison to multi-threading, but still useful for Node.js applications
