WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication): Enables real-time communication in web browsers.
    Primarily designed for peer-to-peer communication, such as audio and video calls, and data sharing between browsers.
    Peer-to-Peer: Establishes direct connections between browsers, reducing latency and server load.
    Security: End-to-end encryption is built into the protocol.
    Use Cases:
        Video conferencing
        VoIP calls
        File sharing between peers
        Screen sharing
    WebRTC uses multiple protocols to enable real-time communication and data exchange, including: 
        Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
        A minimal protocol that provides the tools to implement real-time streaming. 
        Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
        A transport layer protocol that provides reliable and secure file transfer. 
        DTLS
        A protocol that secures all data transfers between peers. 
        ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment)
        A protocol that finds the best path to reach devices and establish a connection between them. 
        STUN/TURN
        A protocol that's necessary to establish and maintain a peer-to-peer connection over UDP. 
        SDP
        A data format used to negotiate the parameters of the peer-to-peer connection. 

WebSocket 
    Purpose:
    Designed for full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, enabling real-time messaging between a client and server.
    -full duplex: Both the client and server can send messages independently without waiting for
    Use Cases:
    Real-time notifications
    Chat applications
    Live updates (e.g., stock tickers, gaming)
