! Redis
*  Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker
*  One of the key features of Redis is its ability to keep all data in memory,
*  which allows for high performance and low latency access to data.

- RDB (Redis Database File): The RDB persistence performs point-in-time snapshots of your dataset at specified intervals.
*   It creates a compact single-file representation of the entire Redis dataset.
*   The snapshotting process can be configured to run at specified intervals, such as every X minutes if Y keys have changed.

- AOF (Append Only File): The AOF persistence logs every write operation received by the server, appending each operation to a file. 
*   This file can then be replayed on startup to reconstruct the dataset. 

` Redis is often used for caching, real-time analytics, messing queue,Pub-Sub , session storage, and ranking.
