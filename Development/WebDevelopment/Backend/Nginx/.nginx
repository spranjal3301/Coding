//!Proxy server 
//*is a server application that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and the server providing that resource.

//` Forward Proxy/Client-Side Proxy: 
//*The proxy server retrieves data from the internet on behalf of the user.

//*Privacy and Security: It helps in masking the client's IP address, providing anonymity,
//* and can be used to bypass geo-restrictions and access blocked content.
//* Caching: It can cache content to improve load times for frequently accessed resources.
//* Access Control: It can be used to enforce policies on internet usage, blocking access to specific websites.

//` Reverse Proxy/Server-Side Proxy:
//* A reverse proxy acts as an intermediary for servers, managing incoming requests from clients. 

//?use
//* Load Balancing: It can distribute incoming requests across multiple servers to improve performance and reliability.
//* Security: It can protect servers by hiding their IP addresses and filtering malicious traffic.(protect against DDoS attacks )
//* SSL Termination: It can handle SSL encryption and decryption, offloading this task from the servers.
//* Caching: responses from the backend servers.
