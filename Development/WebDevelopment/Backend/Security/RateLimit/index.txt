! DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack
* 1. Definition: A DDoS attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of traffic.

- DDoS preventions:
* 1. Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests a user can make in a given time period.
* 2. Traffic Analysis: Monitor traffic patterns to identify and block suspicious activity.
* 3. Web Application Firewalls (WAF): Use WAFs to filter and monitor HTTP traffic to and from a web application.

- Use : Cloudflare, AWS Shield, or other DDoS protection services.


 
!CAPTCHA (app.jsx , captcha.js)
* 1. Definition: CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a type of challenge-response test used to determine whether the user is human or a bot.
* 2. Purpose: CAPTCHAs are used to prevent automated software from performing actions that degrade the quality of service of a given system, such as spamming, brute-force attacks, or scraping.

- Captcha: Implement CAPTCHA challenges to verify that requests are coming from real users and not automated scripts.
