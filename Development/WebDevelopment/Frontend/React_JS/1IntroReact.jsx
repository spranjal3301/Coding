//!Intro to React


//* Static Webpage:
//?                content of the webpage does not change
//* Dom Manipulation:
//?                  use to make Dynamic Webpage
//* Dynamic Webpage:
//?                 HTML&CSS being inserted into the DOM via JavaScript(DOM Manipulation)


//!Why we need to learn React, Vue & Angular why not Vanilla JS(Raw JS)?
//* DOM manipulation is very hard to write as a developer
//* Making dynamic websites, with the primitives that DOM provides you is very hard
//* Better Way of Doing DOM Manipulation

//* 1. Structure and Organization:
//- Component-based structure:
//?breaking your UI into smaller, reusable pieces that are easier to manage, update,code easier to test, maintain, and scale.

//* 2. Efficiency and Performance
//-Virtual DOM (React, Vue):
//? Inmemory representation of the actual website's DOM When changes are needed, they intelligently analyze the Virtual DOM,
//? determine the minimal updates necessary for the real DOM, and execute only those.
//? This drastically improves rendering performance.

//- Reactivity (Vue, Angular in part):
//? let your UI components automatically re-render when underlying data changes.
//?You don't have to manually manipulate the DOM


//!What is React?
//* A JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UI Library) by FaceBook and most Popular.


//! What is React Used For?
//- Single Page Applications (SPAs):
//? React excels in creating dynamic web applications that update smoothly without full page reloads.


//!Libarary vs Framework
//- A library is a collection of reusable code modules, classes, or functions designed to solve specific problems.
// example:React,Vue,Numpy
//-A framework is a comprehensive skeleton or template and flow for how your code should work .It is a collection of libraries and way of wrting code.
// example:Angular, Django



//! Different between React Vue and Angular
//? React is a UI library, and Vue is a progressive framework & Angular is a full-fledged MVC framework

//-React
//? Component-based architecture
//? Uses JSX, a blend of JavaScript and HTML-like syntax
//? Virtual DOM for efficient updates
//? Single-page application
//? No state management often used Redux

//* Vue:
// Component-based architecture
// Uses HTML-based templates
// Virtual DOM for efficient updates
// Single-page application
// Have State management Vuex


//` Angular:
// Full-fledged MVC framework
// TypeScript-based
// Relies on TypeScript and a distinct template syntax that separates HTML, logic, and styles.
// Single-page application
// Have State management NgRx
