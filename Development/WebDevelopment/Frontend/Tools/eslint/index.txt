! ESLint (https://eslint.org/)
-https://projects.100xdevs.com/tracks/eslint/ESLint--Prettier-and-Pre-commit-hooks
* Linting is the process of running a program that analyzes source code
*  to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors
* Static code analysis (process of analyzing code without executing it)

` Why lint?
* Multiple developers in a team can have a similar coding pattern
* Good readability of the code
* Automatic Linting so developer doesnt have to manually lint their code

` Tools
- ESLint (https://eslint.org/) : 
        * A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code.
        * It`s is superSet of Prettier
- Prettier - https://prettier.io/
        * A code formatter that enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules.
- Husky - https://typicode.github.io/husky/
        * Git hooks made easy
        * It allows you to run scripts at different stages of the git process
        * For example, you can run a script before a commit is made, or before a push is made
        * This is useful for running linting and testing scripts before a commit or push is made

`Two types of lints
      - 1. Code analysis (Similar to TS checks)
          * solve issues of : undefined variables, unused variables, etc
          * It is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code.
      - 2. Code formatting (Similar to Prettier checks)
          * solve issues of : space, tabs, semicolons, single('')/double("") qutoes ,etc

Eslint lets you do both 1 and 2
Prettier is used for 2

* --fix-type : Specify the type of fixes to apply
    * code : Code formatting issues
    * layout : Layout issues
    * problem : Problematic issues
