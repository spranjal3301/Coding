//!ECMA Script
//*ECMAScript is a "standard" for a scripting language, JavaScript is an implementation of that standard.

//!JavaScript
//* JavaScript have additional features that are not part of ECMA Script like "DOM manupulation" ....
//*JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content,
//* control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.

//!Common JS Browers Engines
//*V8 (Google Chrome, Chromium, Node.js):C++
//*SpiderMonkey (Firefox): C++ & Rust
//*JavaScriptCore/ Nitro(Safari)


//!Node js 
//*Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript "runtime environment" that runs on the V8 engine 
//*and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

//!Bun js
//*Bun is a JavaScript runtime built from scratch using the Zig programming language. It was replacement for Node.js.
//*Bun uses JavaScriptCore as the JavaScript engine.

//!what is backend?
//* The term "backend" refers to the server-side of a software application or system. 
//*backend is responsible for managing the server, databases, and application logic.

//!Key components of a backend typically include:
//*Server(HTTP)
//*Database
//*Application Logic: 
//*APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): 
//*Security:

//!What is a HTTP?
//*HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is an application protocol(set of rules) used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML
//!What is a HTTP server?
//*An HTTP server is a software application that responds to requests from web browsers by delivering web pages and other web content to the user.
//*When you type a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into your browser's address bar and press Enter, your browser
//*sends a request to the appropriate HTTP server, which then processes the request and sends back the requested information.

//*server can handle multiple requst and multiple domain name points to same sever

//!How to sent Requst to server?
//~Things need to know before Senting request
//* Protocol server using(HTTP/HTTPs)
//* Domain name or IP address/URL/PORT
//* Route
//* Method(GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
//* Headers/Body/Query(?n=9&)/Params(:n)
//~Things need to know before Receiving request
//* Status code
//* Headers/Body

//~ Common HTTP methods include:
//? GET: Retrieves data from the server.(receive quary parameter)
//? POST: Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.(receive body parameter)
//? PUT: Updates a resource or creates a new resource.
//? DELETE: Deletes a specified resource.

//~ What are the common status codes the backend responds with?
//? 1. 200 - Everything is ok
//? 2. 404 - Page/route not found
//? 3. 403 - Authentication issues
//? 4. 500 - Internal server error
