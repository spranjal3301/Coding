To understand TCP/IP, we need to understand the OSI model first.

!OSI model( Open Systems Interconnection model):
- Developed by ISO( International Organization for Standardization).
- Its is set of protocol that allows different differnt architecture systems to communicate with each other.
- Standardization of network communication.

    - 7 layers:
        1. Physical Layer:
            - Physical connection between devices.
            - Data transmission.
            - Bit(0,1).
            - PROTOCOLS: Ethernet,fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet.
            
        2. Data Link Layer:
            - MAC(Media Access Control) address.(Physical addressing)
                -Data Encapsulation: Frame (src MAC+ dest MAC+ Packet).
                -Access the media.
            - Contol Data transmission between devices by check buzy line.
            - Logical Link Control(LLC).
                -Error detection and correction.(CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA)
                -Retransmission.
                - resize the frame.

        3. Network Layer:
            - Routing.
            - path determination(OSPF, RIP, BGP).
            - Logical addressing.
            - Packet (src IP+ dest IP+ Segment).
        4. Transport Layer:
            - End-to-end communication.
            - Error detection and correction(Error control):
                - Parity bit.
                - Checksum.
                - CRC(Cyclic Redundancy Check).
            - Flow control.
            - Segmentation(Seq no,src port no,dec port no,data unit) and reassembly Segment.
            - PROTOCOLS: TCP, UDP.
        5. Session Layer:
            - Establishes, maintains and terminates connections.(session management)
            - Synchronization.
            - Authentication & Authorization.
            - PROTOCOLS: NetBIOS, RPC.
        6. Presentation Layer:
            - Data translation.(ASCII to EBCDIC)
            - Data compression.(lossless and lossy compression)
            - Data encryption/decryption(SSL, TLS).
        7.  Application Layer:
            - User interface.
            - Data exchange.


Network Layer , Transport Layer ,Session Layer , Presentation Layer , Application Layer :are impelemented by software. 


Data Encapsulation:
                    process of adding information to a packet as it moves from one layer to the next, on its way to its destination.
                    
Data Decapsulation:
                    process of removing headers and trailers from a data packet to reveal the original data payload



`Application Layer:
